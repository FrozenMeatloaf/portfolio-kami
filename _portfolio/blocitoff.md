## Explanation

<span class="title-color">Blocitoff</span> is a self-destructing to-do list application.  If after 7 days a users "to-do" is not completed, the program is SUPER smart enough to deem it as "not important" and  POOF...it automatically disappears like any and all of our other ordinary problems! _Yes, that was sarcasm_ or was it?  

<span class="title-color">Blocitoff</span> aided in my understanding of primary Rails fundamentals by adding exciting new gems and ideas to already known best practices.

## Problem

Creating <span class="title-color">Blocitoff</span> posed many new challenges to me.  Unlike projects that said "type this exact thing and watch it work," I was forced to figure out many of my own problems.  These problems included understanding new gems, like [<span class="gem-color">devise</span>](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) or [<span class="gem-color">faker</span>](https://github.com/stympy/faker), creating custom rake commands, introducing new Rails methods like _distance_of_time_in_words_, and figuring out what user stories are more important to complete first.

## Solution

<span class="sub-title">Functionality or Design?</span>

The artist in me wanted to design my application first.  I soon realized starting with design wasn't practical as <span class="title-color">Blocitoff's</span> functionality developed slowly or not at all.  I asked professionals (such as my mentor and my Seattle Meetup group), "_where does a programmer begin?_"  The answer was simple they said, "_start with functionality!_"
