short-description: Welcome to my first Rails Application.  I began this project with little knowledge concerning rails web development.  <span class="title-color">Bloccit</span>, instructed by <span class="bloc-color">Bloc.io</span>, taught me rails fundamentals like routing, RESTful/CRUD practices, RSpec testing, and many more critical programming principles.<div><img src="img/github_icon.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="vertical-align:middle;"> <a href="https://github.com/FrozenMeatloaf/bloccit">github/bloccit</a></div>

## Explanation

<span class="title-color">Bloccit</span> was first when it came to my <span class="bloc-color">Bloc.io</span> curriculum.  The project consisted of many required check-marks to be passed, all of which taught me a new lesson, and all determined by a mentor if fully understood before their completion.  Each check-mark not only lead me to finishing this (my first) project, but provided me the resources and "know-hows" to complete my own applications in the future.

## Problem

Well, to be honest, the first problem I encountered was not having a clue what I was doing.  Outside of having basic Java and web design knowledge already, I really did not know where to begin.  What is CRUD,  how do I generate rails commands, why am I getting this error or the infamous...**WHY ISN'T THIS WORKING!?** were among many battles/problems I faced.  My biggest problem was pondering how to tackle such issues in the development world.  However, I quickly learned how to tackle each of these by utilizing many different valuable resources along the way.
