short-description: Welcome to my first Rails Application.  I began this project with little knowledge concerning rails web development.  <span class="title-color">Bloccit</span>, instructed by <span class="bloc-color">Bloc.io</span>, taught me rails fundamentals like routing, RESTful/CRUD practices, RSpec testing, and many more critical programming principles.<div><img src="img/github_icon.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="vertical-align:middle;"> <a href="https://github.com/FrozenMeatloaf/bloccit">github/bloccit</a></div>

## Explanation

<span class="title-color">Bloccit</span> was first when it came to my <span class="bloc-color">Bloc.io</span> curriculum.  The project consisted of many required check-marks to be passed, all of which taught me a new lesson, and all determined by a mentor if fully understood before their completion.  Each check-mark not only lead me to finishing this (my first) project, but provided me the resources and "know-hows" to complete any application in the future.

## Problem

Well, to be honest, I was challenged by multiple road-blocks creating <span class="title-color">Bloccit</span>.  Outside of having basic Java and web design knowledge already, I really did not know where to begin.  What is CRUD,  how do I generate rails commands, why am I getting this error or the infamous...**WHY ISN'T THIS WORKING!?** were among many battles I faced.  My biggest problem was pondering how to tackle such issues in the development world.  However, I quickly learned how to tackle each of these by utilizing many different valuable resources along the way.

## Solution(s)

{:.center}
<span class="sub-title">Google</span>

May appear as an obvious "go-to," but ask any developer and they'll tell you Google is a valuable resource.  A better understanding about how to ask my question was a big solution when utilizing any search engine.

<span class="sub-title">Reading, reading, and more...reading</span>

I naturally have a thirst for knowledge, especially regarding things I enjoy.  As I began to understand the basics, I still was left with many questions unanswered or curiosities unfulfilled by Bloc's program.  I found answers by reading through countless sources over the web or by purchasing books like "_Eloquent Ruby_ and _Extreme Programming Explained_."

<span class="sub-title">It does not hurt to ask for help</span>

As a beginner, I found myself stuck on many challenges.  After spending hours attempting to solve my own problems, I decided to reach out to mentors and/or StackOverflow.com.

<span class="sub-title">Starting to think like a developer</span>

Naturally feeling overwhelmed was an issue because of how fast I was learning things.  However, I soon realized I was overthinking how things were coded instead of how things worked.  Things became easier once I acknowledged it was about remembering principles and basic fundamentals.

## Results

Completing <span class="title-color">Bloccit</span> subsequently produced successful results that I forever will apply to future applications.

**Comfortable working knowledge of the following:**

* Git commands
* Github (_creating repositories, pushing, pulling, commiting, forking, etc_)
* Heroku
* Rails commands
* Creating a Ruby on Rails Application
* MVC
* CRUD/RESTful practices
* TDD
* Ruby
* HTML/CSS (_Bootstrap_)

**More positive results:**

* What to generally expect when working or viewing a rails application
* How to and where to properly ask programming questions
* Productively pair-program among a team or teammate
* Proactively networked among other "railers" (_eg_. joined RoR meetups in Seattle, WA)




## Conclusion

Like learning any new thing, completing <span class="title-color">Bloccit</span> via <span class="bloc-color">Bloc.io</span> taught me vital programming lessons.  Producing a basic Rails application is easy and fast!  I am now able to not only write code, but read others and apply theirs if needed.  I successfully can ask specific questions clearly and find answers to continue production in a timely manner.  With all the knowledge I acquired by finishing <span class="title-color">Bloccit</span>, I am now ready to learn more by creating others.
